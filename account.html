<!--You must include comments in this assignment. You should put a comment before each function and each major section of the code.-->

<!--Each comment that is used to describe code must be meaningful and accurate. Comments do not necessarily need to be lengthy.-->

<!--A comment should not just repeat what is being done in the code, the purpose of a comment is to describe what and why something is being done.-->
